# 💡 Solutions: Length and Capacity of Slice

> [!NOTE]
> Implement your core logic in the code blocks below to master slice internals.

---

### 1. Create a slice with a length of 5 and a capacity of 10 using `make`.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 2. What does `len(s)` and `cap(s)` represent for a slice `s`?

```go
// Your explanation here
```

---

### 3. Create a slice, append elements until its capacity is exceeded, and print the capacity before and after.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 4. If you create a sub-slice `s2 := s[1:3]`, how are the length and capacity of `s2` determined based on `s`?

```go
// Your core logic & explanation here
```

---

### 5. Write a program that demonstrates a "nil slice" and its length and capacity.

```go
// Your core logic here
```
