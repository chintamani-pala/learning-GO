# Practice Questions: Length and Capacity of Slice

**Topic:** Slice Internals: Len vs Cap

1. Create a slice with a length of 5 and a capacity of 10 using `make`.
2. What does `len(s)` and `cap(s)` represent for a slice `s`?
3. Create a slice, append elements until its capacity is exceeded, and print the capacity before and after.
4. If you create a sub-slice `s2 := s[1:3]`, how are the length and capacity of `s2` determined based on `s`?
5. Write a program that demonstrates a "nil slice" and its length and capacity.
