# 💡 Solutions: If with Short Statement

> [!NOTE]
> Implement your core logic in the code blocks below to master compact conditions.

---

### 1. Write an `if` statement that initializes a variable `num := 10` and then checks if it's greater than 5.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 2. Is the variable initialized in the `if` short statement accessible outside the `if` block?

```go
// Your explanation here
```

---

### 3. Use a short statement in an `if` to check the length of a string.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 4. Rewrite a standard `if` block (with a variable declared before) into an `if` with a short statement.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 5. Explain a scenario where using an `if` with a short statement is cleaner than traditional declaration.

```go
// Your explanation here
```
