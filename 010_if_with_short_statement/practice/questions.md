# Practice Questions: If with Short Statement

**Topic:** Compact Conditions with Initialization

1. Write an `if` statement that initializes a variable `num := 10` and then checks if it's greater than 5.
2. Is the variable initialized in the `if` short statement accessible outside the `if` block?
3. Use a short statement in an `if` to check the length of a string.
4. Rewrite a standard `if` block (with a variable declared before) into an `if` with a short statement.
5. Explain a scenario where using an `if` with a short statement is cleaner than traditional declaration.
