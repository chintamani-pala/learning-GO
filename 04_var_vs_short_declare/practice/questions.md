# Practice Questions: Var vs Short Declare

**Topic:** Variable Declaration Syntax Choices

1. When is it mandatory to use `var` instead of short declaration `:=`?
2. Rewrite `var score int = 100` using the short declaration operator.
3. Can you use `:=` outside of a function body? Explain why or why not.
4. Declare two variables `a` and `b` using a single `:=` statement.
5. What happens if you try to use `:=` to reassign a value to an already declared variable in the same scope?
