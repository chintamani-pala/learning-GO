# 💡 Solutions: Maps

> [!NOTE]
> Implement your core logic in the code blocks below to master key-value pairs in Go.

---

### 1. Declare and initialize a map where keys are strings (country names) and values are strings (capitals).

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 2. How do you add a new key-value pair to an existing map?

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 3. Write a program that checks if a specific key exists in a map and prints its value if it does.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 4. How do you delete a key from a map?

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 5. Write a program that uses `range` to iterate over a map and print all keys and values.

```go
// Your core logic here
```
