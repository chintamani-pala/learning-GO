# 💡 Solutions: Basic Types - Boolean

> [!NOTE]
> Implement your core logic in the code blocks below to master boolean logic and comparisons.

---

### 1. Declare a boolean variable `isGoFun` and assign it `true`. Print its value.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 2. Write an expression that checks if 10 is greater than 5 and store the result in a boolean.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 3. Use the logical AND (`&&`) operator to check if two conditions are both true.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 4. Use the logical NOT (`!`) operator to invert a boolean value.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 5. Create a program that prints the result of `(5 > 3) || (10 < 2)`. What is the expected output?

```go
// Your core logic here
```
