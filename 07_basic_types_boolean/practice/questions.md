1. Declare a boolean variable `isGoFun` and assign it `true`. Print its value.
2. Write an expression that checks if 10 is greater than 5 and store the result in a boolean.
3. Use the logical AND (`&&`) operator to check if two conditions are both true.
4. Use the logical NOT (`!`) operator to invert a boolean value.
5. Create a program that prints the result of `(5 > 3) || (10 < 2)`. What is the expected output?
