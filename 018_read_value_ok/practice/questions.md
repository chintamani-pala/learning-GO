# Practice Questions: Read Value OK

**Topic:** Map Access Pattern (Comma ok)

1. Explain what the "comma ok" idiom is when reading from a map.
2. Write a code snippet that attempts to read a value from a map and prints "Found" or "Not Found" based on the boolean result.
3. What is the value of the first variable in `val, ok := myMap["key"]` if the key does not exist?
4. Why is it safer to use the `ok` check rather than just checking if the returned value is the zero value?
5. Write a program that tries to access a key in a map of integers; if the key doesn't exist, it should initialize it with a default value.
