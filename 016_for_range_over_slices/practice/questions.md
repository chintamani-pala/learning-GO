# Practice Questions: For Range Over Slices

**Topic:** Iterating with Range

1. Write a program that uses `range` to iterate over a slice of integers and print each index and value.
2. How can you iterate over a slice using `range` if you only need the values and not the indices?
3. Write a program that finds the sum of all elements in a float slice using `range`.
4. Can you modify the original slice elements directly inside a `range` loop? Give an example or explain why/why not.
5. Use `range` to iterate over a string and print each character and its index.
