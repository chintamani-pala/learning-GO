# 💡 Solutions: For Range Over Slices

> [!NOTE]
> Implement your core logic in the code blocks below to master iterating with `range`.

---

### 1. Write a program that uses `range` to iterate over a slice of integers and print each index and value.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 2. How can you iterate over a slice using `range` if you only need the values and not the indices?

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 3. Write a program that finds the sum of all elements in a float slice using `range`.

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 4. Can you modify the original slice elements directly inside a `range` loop? Give an example or explain why/why not.

```go
// Your core logic & explanation here
```

---

### 5. Use `range` to iterate over a string and print each character and its index.

```go
// Your core logic here
```
