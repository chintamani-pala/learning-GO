# Practice Questions: Basic Types - Int and Float

**Topic:** Numeric Data Types & Arithmetic Operations

1. Declare an `int` variable and a `float64` variable. Try to add them together. What happens and how do you fix it?
2. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle given a radius (use `math.Pi`).
3. What is the difference between `int8`, `int32`, and `int64`?
4. Write a program that converts a `float64` value to an `int`. Does it round or truncate?
5. Find the remainder of 17 divided by 5 using the modulus operator.
