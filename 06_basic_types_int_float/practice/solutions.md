# 💡 Solutions: Basic Types - Int and Float

> [!NOTE]
> Implement your core logic in the code blocks below to master numeric operations and types.

---

### 1. Declare an `int` variable and a `float64` variable. Try to add them together. What happens and how do you fix it?

```go
// Your core logic & explanation here
```

---

### 2. Write a program to calculate the area of a circle given a radius (use `math.Pi`).

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 3. What is the difference between `int8`, `int32`, and `int64`?

```go
// Your explanation here
```

---

### 4. Write a program that converts a `float64` value to an `int`. Does it round or truncate?

```go
// Your core logic here
```

---

### 5. Find the remainder of 17 divided by 5 using the modulus operator.

```go
// Your core logic here
```
